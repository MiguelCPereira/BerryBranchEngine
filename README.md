# BerryBranchEngine / Q-Bert Remake

This is a C++ component-oriented 2D game engine, developed during the spring of 2021, based on the 3rd party SDL library.

Although it has no visual interface, designing and putting together this library is one of my proudest projects - and the one that has proven itself the most useful, in insight. I have, since the begining of 2021, returned to this library more than a couple of times as a fast prototyping tool, and have even used for another large scale project (my [2048 Reinforcement Learning](https://github.com/MiguelCPereira/2048ReinforcementLearning) research).

As proof of concept, I also remade the 3 first levels, each with 4 rounds, of the classic arcade game [Q-Bert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q*bert), using BerryBranchEngine. Aside from the classic mode we all know and love, a Co-op and a Versus modes were also designed and added, in which you and a friend can either help each other out clearing levels faster, or fight each other as one of you takes control of Coily (the purple snake).

Four functional versions of the game are available under the "Build" folder - two regular versions and two DLL builds (one of each in 32-bit and 64-bit).
